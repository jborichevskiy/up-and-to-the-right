title: "Ideas I'm Thinking or Excited About"
date: 2020-04-05
---

A list of half-baked ideas I'm considering, usually somewhere on the scale between impractical and very impractical. I take no credit for most of these. Nothing new under the sun, right? If you are:

* working on something which sounds like it's listed here

* or have an idea about my idea

* or want to save me time by pointing me to an existing solution

* or want to tell me why it won't work and I'm an idiot

* have something that belongs on here

... then you should [get in touch](/about). I'd love to be a sounding board or just chat about interesting things! Inspired by [this page](https://beepb00p.xyz/ideas.html).

## Collaboration & learning

- [Concept: habit-tracking app](https://www.notion.so/jborichevskiy/Concept-Habit-Tracking-Learning-App-7e28aac50c8f4a73a505c8c38a69447b).
- A regular series where a bunch of friends and I log onto Zoom and watch a lecture, followed by a discussion about it
    - Phrased differently: how can I chat with 5 other people obsessed with the same thing as I am this week? Be it a concept, company, question, or idea?
- Online video discussion platform with automatic transcription, Reddit-style upvoting for questions, auto-merging of similar questions, deep-links to referenced books, talks, podcasts and an auto archive version.
    - Balaji S. Srinivasan: Someone should build Zoom for full remote conferences, and do it right now. ([Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1229111845673459714?s=21))
    - @DennyCloudhead: I wish holding a conference in VR was a thing but current gen is like trying to hold a nuanced, serious business conversation at a furry convention. Until facial tracking is front-and-center, we have a long way to go until VR actually works for personable/readable conversation.

- A private Twitter account only I follow, sourcing tweets from Readwise + Anki
    - Retweet / Like can be used to signal how soon I want to see it again. 
    - Make my social media use more productive 
    - [Inspiration](https://twitter.com/hibyepie/status/1201533152038014978?s=20)
    - [@MehranJal: Spaced Repetition Social Media](http://mjala.li/spacedrepetition.html)
- Livestream a group of programmers (remote, in-person?) collaboratively building something over the course of a week ... open source on Twitch.

## Information organization, discovery, visualization

- Everything described in my [Digital Tools I Wish Existed](/posts/digital-tools) post
- A service to auto-convert any uploaded PDF to HTML, host it, allow markup, discussions
    - Multiple uploads of same file redirect to same URL
    - Git-like versioning system
    - Could be hosted on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)?
    - Aggregate discussions from the internet (Reddit, HN)
- Google results but mapped in 3D with results sortable by longevity, backlink count, search terms. Ability to cross-reference multiple searches. Needs AR + high fidelity hand gestures to be useful. 
- Timeline of one's life overlaid over much longer timeframes and significant events (company foundings, wars, country foundings, inventions, etc) to remind me how short life is.
- Voice interfaces (Alexa, Google Voice, etc) should pause the audio/video stream at the timecode the first cyclable was uttered, not at that point it finished transcribing your speech.
    - I suspect this would make them feel much snappier. 
- Browsers are basically dumpster fires and should be re-built from the ground up
    - [Nikolas Klein: Tab Sort — Improving Tabs in Firefox](https://blog.prototypr.io/tab-sort-improving-tabs-in-firefox-9a727754e8d0#.tj942couz)
- [Future of Information](http://futureofinformation.com/): an exploration of how information might be represented digitally in a more reasonable way

## Browser improvements, extensions

- An extension to color text on Wikipedia according to how long it's been part of the page.
- Wikipedia homepage customized to my interests, topics I'm following, and articles I shared/highlighted previously.
    - Inspiration: [@krrishd: wish wikipedia had a homepage that knew me like youtube](https://twitter.com/krrishd/status/1244823438482477056?s=20)
- Wikipedia: search mode that lists all articles which cite particular book/website as a reference. ([tweet](https://twitter.com/jborichevskiy/status/1245057282229932032?s=20))

## Tech support tools

- A service to let family members collaboratively manage an email for older/non-tech savvy relatives to prevent phishing, and to maintain easy access for tech support.

## Productivity & Health

- Try associating left hand phone use with productive things like reading and flashcard review, and right hand with social media
    - Not sure if this would actually help anything
- Disconnect Day: no internet whatsoever, save for 2 email checks. Ideally weekly.
    - John Carmack: "I was doing a remote study/think time this week, and I tried a “no screen time day” as an experiment ... It was inconclusive" ([Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/1218526548627804161?s=12))
