I'd love to be a sounding board or just chat about interesting things adjacent to any of these!

Inspired by [Dima](https://beepb00p.xyz/ideas.html).

## Meta Tasks

- Ability to generate, update, and search pages like this one
- Subscribe to arbitrary selections of text on similar pages elsewhere, even across a restructure
- Make pages like this more useful to existing search engines and aggregators
- Everything hyperlinkable, shareable, embeddable, and quoteable across platforms

## Collaboration & learning

- A regular series where a bunch of friends and I log onto Zoom and watch a lecture, followed by a discussion about it
  - For blog posts, there is [posobin's blog club](https://posobin.com/blogclub/).
  - Going in-depth on [psychadelics research papers](https://twitter.com/Radix_Motion/status/1244700513435676672?s=20).
  - Phrased differently: how can I chat with 5 other people obsessed with the same thing as I am this week? Be it a concept, company, question, or idea?
    - Twitter seems like **the perfect platform** for spawning this.
- Online video discussion platform with automatic transcription, Reddit-style upvoting for questions, auto-merging of similar questions, deep-links to referenced books, talks, podcasts and an auto archive version.
  - Balaji S. Srinivasan: Someone should build Zoom for full remote conferences, and do it right now. ([Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1229111845673459714?s=21))
  - @DennyCloudhead: I wish holding a conference in VR was a thing but current gen is like trying to hold a nuanced, serious business conversation at a furry convention. Until facial tracking is front-and-center, we have a long way to go until VR actually works for personable/readable conversation. [tweet](https://twitter.com/DennyCloudhead/status/1233839394416713728?s=20)
- Livestream a group of programmers (remote, in-person?) collaboratively building something over the course of a week open source on Twitch.
- Online education platforms that aren't just digitized textbooks. ([tweet](https://twitter.com/jborichevskiy/status/1250173096926908416?s=20))
  - [twitter:Stian Håklev (侯爽)](https://twitter.com/houshuang)
  - [twitter:Raffael Senn](https://twitter.com/sennraf)
- A platform to host casual, unplanned, dynamic events like house parties [note:How do we throw an online party?](posts/patch-notes-v1/)
- [Notion: habit-tracking app](https://www.notion.so/jborichevskiy/Concept-Habit-Tracking-Learning-App-7e28aac50c8f4a73a505c8c38a69447b).

## Information retention

- A private Twitter account only I follow, sourcing tweets from Readwise + Anki
  - Retweet vs Like can be used to signal how soon I want to see it again.
  - Make my social media use more productive
  - [twitter:inspiration thread](https://twitter.com/hibyepie/status/1201533152038014978?s=20)
  - [@MehranJal: Spaced Repetition Social Media](http://mjala.li/spacedrepetition.html)

{{< tweet 1205206517101858816 >}}

## Better ways to publish information

- Being able to publish text online without worrying about security, hosting, searchability, ease of translation, monetizability, ease of reference
  - I'm a software developer, and it took longer than it should to set up a blog from scratch.
- Arbitrary platform agnostic annotation system
- [CJ Eller: Blogging Futures](https://blog.cjeller.site/blogging-futures)
- [tweet:Azlen Elza](https://twitter.com/azlenelza/status/1246612847427112960?s=20): "The ability to zoom out and explore interconnections, whether within your own blog or external links to other sources"

## Information organization, discovery, visualization

- Everything described in [post:Digital Tools I Wish Existed](/posts/digital-tools)
- Peer to peer decentralized social media networks
  - [HELIOS: Context aware distributed social network](https://helios-social.com/)

  - Needs AR + high fidelity hand gestures to be useful
- Timeline of one's life overlaid over much longer timeframes and significant events (company foundings, wars, country foundings, inventions, etc) to remind me how short life is.
- [Future of Information](http://futureofinformation.com/): an exploration of how information might be represented digitally in a more reasonable way

- Integrated, contextual full-text search on any published information that searches multiple references deep

## Browsers

{{< tweet 1209715374561693696>}}

- Browsers are basically dumpster fires and should be re-built from the ground up
- When have I been on this page before?
  - [karlicoss:Promnesia: explore your browsing history in context](https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia)
  - [Ampie by @posobin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ampie/): See what links have been tweeted by your friends right on the webpage
  - [@round: Twitter Links Extension](https://twitter.com/round/status/1240043788078211072)
- Cache a copy of the page I'm on for 30 days to make it searchable
  - [Memex by Worldbrain.io](https://worldbrain.io/)
  - [ArchiveBox](https://github.com/pirate/ArchiveBox)
- Allow me to search by two words that appeared several pages apart in my browsing history
- A browser tab system that isn't a 1D line of boxes, the utility of which goes down the as the complexity of my task goes up
  - [Nikolas Klein: Tab Sort — Improving Tabs in Firefox](https://blog.prototypr.io/tab-sort-improving-tabs-in-firefox-9a727754e8d0#.tj942couz)
- Save my last position on long pages
- Allow me to share any arbitrary pixel-specific position on a page with any other browser in the world

## Wikipedia

- Homepage customized to my interests, topics I'm following, and articles I shared/highlighted previously.
  - The ability to "subscribe" to a paragraph or a page and be notified of important changes.
  - [@krrishd: wish wikipedia had a homepage that knew me like youtube](https://twitter.com/krrishd/status/1244823438482477056?s=20)
- Search mode which lists all articles which cite particular book/website as a reference. ([tweet](https://twitter.com/jborichevskiy/status/1245057282229932032?s=20))
- Color text on Wikipedia by various metrics
  - how long it's been part of the page
  - how frequently this this area is edited/reverted
  - how many times this section is referenced relative to others on this page and/or article family
- Let me explore people's Wikipedia binges and any notes or edits they made along the way

## Calendar apps

- Search by all local events happening within the next hour that I might be interested in, which are hosted:
  - by venues I have been to recently
  - by foundations and projects I am supporting or following
  - by people in my network
  - about topics I am interested in
- Let me easily be found by organization that need volunteer support in something I can help with
- Google: instead of that stupid note field, **at least** give us a linked Google Drive document with some metadata pre-inserted
- Let me see my calendar on my map
- Ability to create ad-hoc reading clubs
- What emails did I have open when I created this event?
- Auto-find a time slot based on past instances between any number of calendars
- Turn any text which looks like a date and time on see on my screen into an event in my calendar
- [twitter:Christopher Mikel Shelton](https://twitter.com/Chris8307) has thought a lot about this

## Zoom & most other video chat apps

- Link Twitter profiles to Zoom accounts instead of everyone dropping a dozen links into chat
- A useable chat, preferably approaching the level of Slack's
- Toggle to just override other people's backgrounds with a gray screen so I can focus on what they're saying
- Breakout rooms I can switch to faster than it takes my computer to boot up
- A repository of publicly-accessible events and lectures happening now
  - [Pioneer:rishi_t: ZoomTV:Channel-surf the Internet](https://frontier.pioneer.app/posts/118-zoomtv-channel-surf-the-internet)
- Integrated agendas
  - [Azlen Elza:Micro Learning Futures #1, 2, & 3](https://azlen.me/projects/micro_learning_futures/)

## Slack probably deserves its own page

- [Abe Winter: Slack is the opposite of organizational memory](https://abe-winter.github.io/plea's/help/2018/02/11/slack.html)
- [Julian Lehr: Superhuman & the Productivity Meta-Layer](https://julian.digital/2020/01/17/superhuman-the-productivity-meta-layer/)
- [Kevin Kwok: The Arc of Collaboration](https://kwokchain.com/2019/08/16/the-arc-of-collaboration/)
- [Alex Petrache: How Focus Became More Valuable Than Intelligence](https://alexand.ro/2018/08/how-focus-became-more-valuable-than-intelligence)
- Ability to send people non-urgent DMs ([tweet](https://twitter.com/jborichevskiy/status/1251334510823632897?s=20))
- Notify only one person in the channel of each message round-robin style
  - A sort of ad-hoc pagerduty
- Use more distinction than a red unread icon: DMs from execs and bots in #random should not be given the same alert weight
- Synchronize my base notification preferences across workspaces
- Get rid of that asinine Slackbot
- A more useful Unreads screen
  - Centralized unreads center across my 15 workspaces
  - Unreads are grouped by channel _and_ arrival making it hard to triage
  - Clicking on a message takes you to the thread that messaged happened to be in, as opposed to something like a focused email chain
  - The issue/bug/disaster may have already been resolved but there's no way to retroactively pull notifications back
- Ability to view multiple threads at once
- Freeze gifs if the window isn't active to stop distracting me
- Enforce a more rigid channel hierarchy
- Ability to annotate messages with types, to start: question, decision, announcement
- Ability to quote a message to reply to it directly, like on Telegram
- **There should be no distinction between messaging, documentation, and issue tracking as much of this data is copied back and forth anyway - as soon as text is copied you lose context**

## Twitter

I have a love hate relationship with Twitter. It's an incredible tool, but I think certain product decisions are keeping it from reaching its 100x potential.

- An API that works and doesn't arbitrarily deny people like me. [patch notes v2](https://jborichevskiy.com/posts/patch-notes-v1/)
- Search that isn't garbage in every way, shape, and form
  - Ability to search every tweet, reply, or profile bio I've ever looked at
  - One-click search from someone's profile page to the search bar pre-populated with `from: username`
  - Ability to search through my bookmarks
  - Let me filter out duplicate tweets and URLs
- Ability to navigate tweet threads more comfortably
  - [twitter:michael_nielson: A meta-thread of some of my favourite Twitter threads](https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1061824470556467200)
  - [twitter:Dan Abramov: relationship advice thread. What I wish knew when I was 20](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1224308095070896134?s=20)
- Some magical buttons
  - "notify me of further responses to this tweet" button
  - "have I interacted with this person before?" button
    - Show me their tweets I've liked, tweets of mine they have liked, tweets we have both liked, replies to each other, etc
  - "I would like this answer questioned as well" button, more granular than the retweet button
  - "I would pay for this" button
- Ability to assign a type to a tweet:
  - question
  - announcement
  - proposition
  - assumption
  - request for information
  - request for action
  - request for advice
  - reference
  - update
- One-click addition references to dates and times into my calendar
  - Let me book & pay for the event from the app, take a cut
- Mute a thread from appearing again
  - Ideally this could be extended to muting a conversation or meme as well
- Ability to add a note to any profile
  - Ability to see what other accounts I followed at the time I followed this one
- Ability to filter by topic
- Buckets that can automatically collect tweets until there's enough to look at
- Ability to filter for someone's most popular tweets

- Let me message every mutual that lives in $city when I land there

## Hacker News

- [Dan Grossman: E-mail Notifications for Hacker News Comment Replies tool](http://www.hnreplies.com/)
- Can't sort/filter for topics like on [Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/)
- Ability to annotate users, highlight past interactions

## Gmail

- Unified inbox on desktop
- What searches did I run over the course of this thread being open?
- What documents did I edit last time I emailed this group of people?
- Show me emails in Google search other than my flight bookings
- 1-click delete & mute filter

## Roam Research

- search aggregator for publicly accessible instances
- ability to embed other people's blocks into my own private db
- more granular sharing
- updates on changes to other databases
- a lot more...

## Podcast apps

{{<tweet 1249526881176576000>}}

- [CJ Pais: Project Goals](https://wiki.cjpais.com/project-goals) is building something in this space and I am very excited
- [iOS: Airr - Share podcast clips](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/airr-share-podcast-clips/id1355926315?ls=1)
  - [twitter: AirrAudio](https://twitter.com/AirrAudio)
  - supports making highlights on episodes directly, with some podcasts pre-transcribed
- The ability to take timecoded, transcribed comments on any part of podcast
  - [Stian Håklev (侯爽): a blog post on combining ListenNotes, Otter.ai, and taking good notes](https://twitter.com/houshuang/status/1247165721190100992?s=20)
  - [ListenNotes: a podcast search engine](https://www.listennotes.com/)
- better ways of finding episodes
  - What are the most popular episodes in this podcast?
  - Has a person I follow on Twitter appeared in this podcast?
  - Have they recommended an episode recently?
- better navigation
  - possible to process waveforms into different color by different speakers?
  - have scrubbing snap to long pauses or changes in tone?
  - Search by keyword instead of scrubbing
  - Voice control, "navigate 15 seconds back"
- sharing and archival
  - share a link with a timecode on Spotify
  - ability to add a podcast episode to a playlist on desktop
    - [complaint tweet](https://twitter.com/jborichevskiy/status/1250240717684760576?s=20) - response: "do it on mobile"
- Save a history of my played episodes (how is this not a default feature I do not know)

### Voice interfaces for controlling software

- Voice recognition that can keep up with the speed of a rambling caffinated speech accurately
  - We are getting closer with [Otter.ai](https://otter.ai/) for transcription
- Voice interfaces (Alexa, Google Voice, etc) should pause the audio/video stream at the timecode the first cyclable was uttered, not at that point it finished transcribing your speech.
  - I suspect this would make them feel much snappier.

# Misc

- Standardized one-click annotations from a Youtube link to a URL

## Hardware

- Augmented reality that works.
  - Needs to be cheap, useable, and affordable. It is none of these yet.
  - Navigation is probably the first thing I would add here, what Google Glass was supposed to be able to do
  - Interactive education about my environment would be next
- Bluetooth headphones that don't take 5 seconds, several beeps, and a burp or two to switch from my laptop to my phone
- Wall-size touchscreens that I can afford

## Software development & debugging

{{< tweet 1247267933383872512>}}

- One-click search of every line of code I've typed for this organization or in personal utilities
- Instant visualization of every PR comment or bug tied to this line, function, or file
- Weigh StackOverflow questions I looked at higher in my collaborators' web searches
- Have a one-click button to turn a series of Slack messages into a documentation page

## Tech support tools

- A service to let family members collaboratively manage an email for older/non-tech savvy relatives to prevent phishing, and to maintain easy access for tech support.
- Screensharing that's easier to initiate than the buggy iMessage version

## Productivity & Health

- [post:concentration compromise](/posts/concentration-compromise) is everything I know about the intersection of productivity and digital communication
- Try associating left hand phone use with productive things like reading and flashcard review, and right hand with social media
  - Not sure if this would actually help anything
- Disconnect Day: no internet whatsoever, save for 2 email checks. Ideally weekly.
  - John Carmack: "I was doing a remote study/think time this week, and I tried a “no screen time day” as an experiment ... It was inconclusive" ([twitter thread](https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/1218526548627804161?s=12))

## This page

- Tags and filtering
- Ability to navigate it better
