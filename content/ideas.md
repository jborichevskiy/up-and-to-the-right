title: "Ideas I'm Thinking About"
date: 2019-01-17

A list of half-baked ideas I'm considering, usually somewhere on the scale between impractical and very impractical. I take no credit for most of these. Nothing new under the sun, right? If you are:

* working on something which sounds like it's listed here

* or have an idea about my idea

* or want to save me time by pointing me to an existing solution

* or want to tell me why it won't work and I'm an idiot

... then you should [get in touch](/about). I'd love to be a sounding board or just chat about interesting things! Inspired by [this page](https://beepb00p.xyz/ideas.html).

## Collaboration & learning

- A regular series where a bunch of friends and I log onto Zoom and watch a lecture, followed by a discussion about it
- Online video discussion platform with automatic transcription, Reddit-style upvoting for questions, auto-merging of similar questions, deep-links to referenced books, talks, podcasts and an auto archive version.
- A private Twitter account only I follow, sourcing tweets from Readwise + Anki
    - Retweet / Like can be used to signal how soon I want to see it again. 
    - Make my social media use more productive

## Information organization, discovery, visualization

- Everything described in my [Digital Tools I Wish Existed](/posts/digital-tools) post
- A service to auto-convert any uploaded PDF to HTML, host it, allow markup, discussions
    - Multiple uploads of same file redirect to same URL
    - Git-like versioning system
    - Could be hosted on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)?
    - Aggregate discussions from the internet (Reddit, HN)
- Google results but mapped in 3D with results sortable by longevity, backlink count, search terms. Ability to cross-reference multiple searches. Needs AR + high fidelity hand gestures to be useful. 
- Timeline of one's life overlaid over much longer timeframes and significant events (company foundings, wars, country foundings, inventions, etc) to remind me how short life is.

## Browser improvements, extensions

- An extension to color text on Wikipedia according to how long it's been part of the page.

## Tech support tools

- A service to let family members collaboratively manage an email for older/non-tech savvy relatives to prevent phishing, and to maintain easy access for tech support.

## Productivity & Health

- Try associating left hand phone use with productive things like reading and flashcard review, and right hand with social media
    - Not sure if this would actually help anything
- Disconnect Day: no internet whatsoever, save for 2 email checks. Ideally weekly.
