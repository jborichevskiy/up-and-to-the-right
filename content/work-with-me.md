Hi, I'm Jon!

I love building tools to connect us in humane and fun ways.

I am confident building in exploratory, research-driven teams while coordinating with surrounding community - whether through blog posts or live digital events.

I believe in sustainable, open, and inclusive approaches to engineering. Excited about decentralized tools emphasizing user comfort and sustainability.

Read more on [digital tools I wish existed](/posts/digital-tools), [my plans for building them](https://jon.bo/posts/next-steps-2019), and [various other ideas](/ideas). For more about me, see [About Me](/about).

_Looking for_: part-time work around smart contracts and/or full-stack Python, Node, or Elixir development in web3.

_Open to_: DAOs, experimental community organizations, and traditional orgs & consulting arrangements. Fully remote preferred.
