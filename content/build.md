Hi, I'm Jon!

I love building tools to connect us in humane and fun ways. 

I enjoy working with exploratory, research-driven teams while coordinating with surrounding communities - whether through blog posts or in online/offline events. I am experienced in fullstack engineering with React/Typescript, Solidity, Python, and Elixir as well as deploying and managing AWS, Vercel, Railway, EVM based blockchains, and bespoke distributed local infrastructure as needed. 

I believe in sustainable, open, and inclusive approaches to engineering and am excited for decentralized tools that emphasize good user experience and healthy core values. Read more on [digital tools I wish existed](/posts/digital-tools) and a little more [about me](/about).

## How I Like to Build

- high trust relationships where we say what we intend to do, and then we do it
- safety to mess up; holding mistakes as learning opportunities
- cross functional teams, working very closely with design, space to understand the needs and challenges of the users from more perspectives than purely engineering
- comfortable with rapid iteration and explorative/experimental contexts
- talking to users, understanding their use cases, needs, delights, and annoyances
- comfortable interfacing directly with other organizations / projects, exploring the in-between spaces of partner companies, user communities, and developer ecosystems
- shipping small things frequently, affording a continuous feedback loop with reality
- keen on opportunities for pair programming and learning together as well as solo deep dives
