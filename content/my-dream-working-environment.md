What does my ideal working environment look and feel like?

I want to acknowledge what an absolute privilege it is to be able to build things digitally and get paid money through the internet for it. I hope with time this becomes the default working and learning environment for anyone who prefers it and am interested in making that a likelier reality.

Must-haves

 - Stable electricity

 - Protection from the elements

 - Access to a clean bathroom

 - Customizable temperature

       - For me, that’s 72 degrees Farenheight. Any higher and and I start noticing my environment. A few degrees lower is fine.

Nice-to-haves

 - Ability to walk somewhere beautiful outside

       - For a while, I worked in an office in a city on a busy street, where I would spend my lunch hour near and join my coworker for his smoke breaks. My only escape was one of three nearby parks to get a semblance of a relaxing environment. I would try to spend them listening to a podcast or audiobook: a change of scenery and task does the mind wonderful things. 

       - I suppose it was a bit difficult in that regard. But it’s also not to be understated: nowhere outside a major city do you get to experience the full range of art, culture and a diverse population of people all living in general harmony together. 


       - I probably will oscillating between the two for a while.

 - Good, affordable food nearby

 - Adjustable desk with at least one large high-resolution monitor. I use a 1440p monitor but wish for something that doesn’t exist: something the same size but three times wider. Part of it high-resolution, low-latency e-ink displays. And the other section, a giant iPad. 

 - It should basically surround my field of vision, but that’s ok because the only thing behind it is a bunch of leafy plants. Or cacti. or flowers. Whatever makes you feel most comfortable. It also allows me to work by looking straight onto a monitor at my natural angle. 

       - Eventually this will be full VR. Still a bit far away, and I’m not sure when it’ll come closer to just getting me the environment describe, minus the ability to take it off and stay there.
