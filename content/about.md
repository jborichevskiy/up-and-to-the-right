My name is Jonathan Borichevskiy, but most friends just call me Jon.

**Always** I enjoy learning and building things with computers. Passionate about cognitive science, environmental sustainability, and software engineering. 

**Future** Open to opportunities to be able to connect my passions with big problems - if you have suggestions, please reach out via means below. Areas of interest include cleaner energy, more effective education and therapy, lowering access cost to space, and better democratic decision-making.

**Now** Founding Engineer at [Vigilant](https://vigilant.cc) in New York City, where I get to work with lots of open data.

**Before** Born in Sacramento, California. Co-founded [Yedi Software](https://www.yedi.io/), an attempt at improving 3PL marketplace efficiency. 

Citizen of Planet Earth.
