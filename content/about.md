My name is Jonathan Borichevskiy, but most friends just call me Jon.

**Always** • I enjoy learning and building things with computers. Passionate about cognitive science, environmental sustainability, and software engineering. 

**Future** • Looking for opportunities for connecting my passions with big problems - if you have a suggestion, please reach out via below links. Areas of interest include cleaner energy, effective education and therapy, lowering cost of access to space, artificial intelligence, and better institutional and democratic decision-making.

**Now** • Founding Engineer at [Vigilant](https://vigilant.cc) in New York City, where I work with lots of open data and do backened development with some SRE.

**Before** • Grew up in Sacramento, California. Co-founded [Yedi Software](https://www.yedi.io/), an attempt at improving 3PL marketplace efficiency. 

Citizen of Planet Earth.
