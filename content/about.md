My name is Jonathan Borichevskiy, but most friends just call me Jon.

**Always** • I enjoy learning and building things with computers. Passionate about cognitive science, environmental sustainability, and software engineering. 
 
**Future** • Looking for opportunities to connect my passions with solving big problems - if you have a suggestion, please reach out via below links. Areas of interest include but are not limited to cleaner energy, more effective education and therapy, lowering cost of access to space, artificial intelligence, and better institutional and democratic decision-making. Read more [here](/posts/next-steps-2019).

**Now** • Developing [greenCart](https://greencart.app) for the [Fixathon](https://fixathon.io/). Exploring some long-neglected ideas and side projects. Reviewing Calculus with [Paul's Online Notes](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/). Reading [Brain that Changes Itself](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/570172.The_Brain_that_Changes_Itself). 

**Before** • Founding Engineer at [Vigilant](https://vigilant.cc), where I worked on acquiring lots of public data, back-end development skills, and some SRE experience. Co-founded [Yedi Software](https://www.yedi.io/), an attempt at improving 3PL marketplace efficiency. Grew up in Sacramento, California.
