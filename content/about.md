My name is Jonathan Borichevskiy, but most friends just call me Jon.

I enjoy learning and building with networks. Also concerts, hikes, sunsets, and long walks with friends. Cognitive science, sustainability, and code. Hoping to combine them. [How I think about life](/posts/up-and-to-where).

**Future** • [I want to help build tools for humanity](/posts/help-build). [My next life steps](/posts/patch-notes-v12/#next-steps-2021-update).

**Now** • see [here](/now) and some [ideas](/ideas) for later.

**Before** • founding engineer at [Ressemble](https://ressemble.com) and [illumis](https://illumis.com/) and [Yedi Software](https://www.yedi.io/). [Born and raised](/posts/on-moving-away) in Sacramento, California.

I love [journaling](/posts/journaling), [how I stay focused](/posts/concentration-compromise), and [some of my habits](/posts/healthy-living).
