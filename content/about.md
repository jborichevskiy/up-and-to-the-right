My name is Jonathan Borichevskiy, but most friends just call me Jon.

I enjoy learning and building things (usually with computers and the internet), concerts, hikes, and connecting with people. Cognitive science, sustainability, and code. Hoping to combine them. [My life philosophy](/posts/up-and-to-where).

**Future** • [things I want to build](/posts/help-build). In sumary: helping improve collaborative knowledge and communications tools, clean energy, effective education and therapy, cost to space, artificial intelligence, and better institutional and democratic decision-making. I aim to be running my own R&D lab by 2030. [My next life steps](/posts/patch-notes-v12/#next-steps-2021-update).

**Now** • See my [Now](/now) page and a list of [ideas I'm exploring](/ideas).

**Before** • Founding Engineer at [illumis](https://illumis.com/), where I worked on acquiring lots of public data, back-end development skills, and some SRE experience. Co-founded [Yedi Software](https://www.yedi.io/), an attempt at improving 3PL marketplace efficiency. [Born and raised](/posts/on-moving-away) in Sacramento, California.

I love [journaling](/posts/journaling), [how I stay focused](/posts/concentration-compromise), and [my habits](/posts/healthy-living).
