Hi, I'm Jon!

I love building tools to connect us in humane and fun ways. 

I am a full stack engineer confident in React/Typescript, Solidity, Python, and Elixir. I enjoy building with exploratory, research-driven teams while coordinating with the surrounding communities - whether through blog posts or live online and offline events.

I believe in sustainable, open, and inclusive approaches to engineering and am excited for decentralized tools that emphasize good user experience and sustainability.

## How I Like to Build

- high trust relationships where we say what we intend to do, and then we do it
- safety to mess up; holding mistakes as learning opportunities
- cross functional teams, working very closely with design, space to understand the needs and challenges of the users from more perspectives than purely engineering
- comfortable with rapid iteration and explorative/experimental contexts
- getting to talk to the users, understanding their use cases, needs, delights
- comfortable interfacing with other companies / projects, exploring the in-between spaces of partner companies, user communities, and developer ecosystems
- shipping small things frequently, affording a continuous feedback loop with reality
- opportunities for pair programming and learning together as well as solo deep dives
