Not long after writing my previous post [on moving away](/posts/on-moving-away/) from Sacramento I took the opportunity to extend a week-long visit back home to four weeks. In contrast to my typical rushed and sleepless weekend visits this one has given me the chance to slow down and spend real, unhurried time with family and friends for the first time in over two years. Long story short: it’s pretty different out here!

### Energy and Pace

Probably the most jarring has been the intense downshift to the pace of life here. After two years of living on the Lower East Side while working at a startup and trying to find enough time to maintain a diverse social life, my fitness, reading, entertainment and travel - living in the suburbs of Sacramento is like watching life at quarter-speed. New York is a city where you can jam down the accelerator on almost any dimension - be it work, partying, meeting people, exploring hobbies, or dating - and still have people zooming past you in every possible sense of the word. You can’t hit the speed limit - it arguably doesn’t exist. Not so here.

K Street in midtown (which always seemed like the liveliest place in Sac prior to moving away) doesn’t come close to the level that Lower East Side or Williamsburg get to on typical Friday night. I’d forgotten what falling asleep without earplugs is like! Walking through Financial District or (heaven forbid) Midtown in New York on a typical weekday feels like you have to actively resist being caught up in the intense hubbub of getting shit done and avoiding getting steamrolled by the crowds rushing back from lunch. Here the only sign a business park is filled with living humans is the sea of cars in the parking lot. A sea which empties much earlier than New York’s typical 7-8p workday conclusion. I find it hard to think of a place in Sacramento with anything approaching the person per square foot density of Brookfield Place or Washington Square Park short of festivals or holiday events. Not that the work and party culture in New York is healthy by any measure - but you’re never at risk of being bored, that’s for sure. 

### Food and Coffee

There’s no denying I’ve been spoilt silly by New York’s food scene. Hungry? A short 15 minute walk from my apartment gets me to an assortment of incredible cuisines from all over the world, almost always at a reasonable price. A thirty-minute subway ride expands that radius to anything I could possibly desire from blindfolded culinary experiences to Michelin 3-star restaurants. Even my mostly plant-based diet these days poses almost no trouble. On the other hand, figuring out where to go eat in Roseville or Rocklin (two major suburbs here) feels like what I imagine pre-agricultural nomadic tribes must’ve felt like figuring out what to consume for dinner. I’d like to point out that I’m not a food snob, nor am I exceedingly picky. Shared meal experiences for me are far more about the people and the conversation rather than the food, drinks, or presentation. But if I have to choose between the sliders, the burger, or the wings from anther run-of-the-mill New American restaurant menu while sitting on a hi-top metal stool a couple more times I might cry. It’s worth noting that this does not describe the situation in midtown Sac; on the contrary the food scene there is lively and by all accounts growing, particularly with the [farm-to-fork movement](https://www.visitsacramento.com/visit/farm-to-fork/). Specialty coffee (adjusted for location density) is on par with New York and does not disappoint at all.

### Driving

While I wouldn’t consider myself a motorhead I have driven an assortment of vehicles - a number of which at high velocities - and the feeling of being pressed into your seat while cornering a banked turn with some actual horsepower under you absolutely never gets old. The Valley is incredible for this. If you avoid the interstates, traveling in almost any direction will offer up a plethora of roads and environments including gentle rolling hills and picturesque farmland, unprotected one-lane highways along the coast, steep 13% grade climbs, winding mountain roads with skid marks trailing right off into the abyss and gorgeous tree-lined roads surrounded by forest. Rolling the windows down and blasting some music while cruising along is one of life’s greatest pleasures. However, like with anything it’s worth mentioning the negative sides of car culture too. And boy are there are a lot of them.

First, fueling up: the gas stations have entered the twenty first century and added contactless support which is nice and all but doesn’t distract from the fact that I’m literally pouring money from my wallet into the gas tank, now simply by tapping my phone. It hurts. Rush hour in Manhattan is no fun, but being stuck in a car on a four-lane highway in stop-and-go traffic is absolutely aggravating. Stop, go, stop, next track, go. You’re just sitting there unable to do anything useful aside from listening to podcasts or an audiobook since you have to keep your eyes on the road. And good luck [thinking happy thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKle3esN4fw) while getting cut off by yet another asshole while seeing billboard after billboard inch by. At least you can close your eyes and pretend the ads don’t exist on the MTA subways. Such behavior won’t end well on the road.

Next, the environmental cost: cars are a [horrendously inefficient form of transportation](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/CharmingShamelessFrogmouth-mobile.mp4), particularly without carpooling. Making the roads bigger [just scales up](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/09/citylab-university-induced-demand/569455/) the number of vehicles on the road. Car and biking infrastructure are not complementary by default meaning biking to work is often dangerous and stressful. Parking lots take up an enormous amount of space and limit how close together dining and entertainment venues can be positioned. And finally, the deaths tolls: it’s extremely dangerous especially with today’s distracted driving, terrible car interfaces, chronic sleep-deprivation, and drunk driving. I can see now why my mother began every car trip with a prayer when we were kids - it’s a dangerous battlefield out there. 

Should we ban cars? Obviously not. The structure of many U.S. cities is both shaped by, and now dependent on every household owning 1-2 cars. That’s not changing without massive infrastructure investment, and in many cases will be near-impractical. But I sure am excited for self-driving cars. While I think there will always be room for enjoyable driving (road trips, country, etc) the bulk of the simple home-work-shopping-home driving can, should be, and will be handled in a safer, more efficient, and more pleasurable manner than what we have today. Imagine using your commute to dial into the first call at work and being able to devote your full attention to it without risking your life, or catching an extra 30 minutes of sleep. It’s not perfect, but it’s headed in the right direction.

### Nature

No post exploring the ([sadly, former](https://medium.californiasun.co/sacramento-city-of-trees-207ed2a7e05a?gi=ed07a3b0099a)) City of Trees would be complete without discussing nature and the point goes squarely to Sacramento on this one. During my short stay so far I’ve managed to go on several hikes, spend a couple nights in a hammock on the shore of a lake, gaze out at the stars and see the Milky Way (I tend to forgot just how small we are), and witness a handful of jaw-dropping sunsets. I can’t believe I took this for granted before - but it’s easy to see why; it just doesn’t take any special effort. You just grab your stuff and hop into the car sitting in your driveway and 40 minutes later you’re at a trailhead. It’s beautiful, relaxing, and absolutely irreplaceable. I’ve been on hikes around New York - but it’s not the same. The weather is a lot less cooperative, there are trains and shuttles to worry about, the hills are paltry compared to a mountain range, and it’s easy to forget there are even stars out there with the city’s incessant light footprint. Scientists are finding [ample evidence](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/sour-mood-getting-you-down-get-back-to-nature) for the therapeutic, restorative, and calming effects of nature but [authors and poets have been touting them for centuries](https://www.rei.com/blog/camp/the-nature-fix-night-sky). It’s only recently that we’ve managed to forget about the outside - and I’m hopeful we’ll start remembering about it soon. And nothing beats a west coast sunset.

### Coast to Coast

I won’t deny comparing the suburbs of Sacramento to Manhattan is a bit apples to oranges. They have vastly different demographics, economies, appeals, and a 5x population difference. A one-to-one comparison wouldn’t do much good to anyone, and I’d have a hard time picking a “better” one - so much depends on one's stage of life, the people I’m with, and my priorities. I’m instead trying to highlight just a few of the differences in subjective experience to friends in New York who have yet to visit an American suburb or others in Sacramento who have never experienced New York. Not that this is at all representative of California - much less the numerous other regions throughout the country. There is no end to the diversity of American people, cities, cultures, and geographies and this fact is vital to remember when trying to consider national policies, news stories from across the country, and the future of this country.
