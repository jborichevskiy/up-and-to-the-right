title: things I want to help build

The following are efforts I hope to contribute to over the following decades. If you're researching, building, or excited about any of these -- let's chat!

1. **combining journaling + therapy**

   Therapy needs to be more scalable. While it can achieve amazing things, its current form generally requires money and is subject to severe 1:1 time constraints. Talk therapy is also limited to the verbal communication channel.

   Journaling is an excellent form of self-therapy; and happens to be completely free & accessible to anyone. It can benefit from accountability, external review, and guiding. I see the potential of a hybrid approach combining the two.

1. **building towards sustainability**

   We're headed for some pretty complicated physical, social, and economical changes. There are many more important areas here but some particular points of focus for me:

   - disaster recovery / internet restoration
   - more efficient logistics & transport
   - education & awareness
   - cheap, weather-resilient, humane emergency sheltering
   - renewable energy
   - cross-language coordination tools

1. **experimental cities in nature**

   I want to live in a forest or on a beach with a gym, cafeteria, multiple cafes, high speed internet, a garden, and enough other nerds nearby to join a different salon / workshop / lecture every night. Also:

   - tooling for self-managing and maintaining a Social API to rest of the world
   - re-configurable, expandable, and financially self-sustainable
   - discoverable internationally while maintaining local culture & access
   - sliding scale cost structured as hybrid scholarships / exploration grants
   - accommodating of both short term/transitory stays and longer-term residencies
   - accessible to RVs, cars, and tents
   - ecologically balanced

1. **distributed tools for thought**

   Better ways of talking with friends I haven't met yet. Both ends of the stack are important here: how our phones send raw data to each other and the shape of the digital surface I'm communicating my thoughts through. - can decision-making processes be more inviting and intimate? - varying scales of anonymous:identified, retained and ephemeral, structured vs serendipitous - make publishing to limited/unlimited social networks more natural

1. **psychedelics research**

   Seeing as these drugs changed my life, I'm interested in helping more people getting the opportunity for self-discovery and healing with them. Specifically:
   a) removing legal barriers
   b) providing safe spaces to experience them
   c) building online/offline spaces for discussion & education

1. **libraries of the future**

   I owe a lot to libraries as a kid and hope future generations can find as much support access as they gave me. The library of the future: - open 24/7, like internet cafes - fresh coffee - beastly computers, consoles, and internet connections - loaner e-readers and electronics - 3D printers - plants + natural light - local and community-managed - a default meeting point for online/offline communities

For now, I'm going to hack on these projects with friends as small-scale experiments, notes, and chats. With time I hope to deepen my potential impact by coordinating and creating space for people to come together and collaborate on these problems.
