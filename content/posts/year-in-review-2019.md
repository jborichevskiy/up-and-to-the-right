It's been a long year. I learned a lot about the world as well as myself. Cried more than ever. Accomplished a few things and failed at many others. Some reflections and observations with related readings.

### Personal / Life

- Be yourself. Because that’s the coolest version of you there is.
- Dancing is cathartic. Just use the music as the metronome and rhythm and move your body as if you’re creating the music. Most importantly, have fun. 
- Harnessing curiosity is like pouring rocket fuel onto your learning capacity.
- Creativity = time + inspiration + iterative output + feedback. Learn to nurture it. 
- I'm not as unique as I thought I was growing up. There are a lot of people out there like me -- excited about the same future, and struggling with the same problems. Just gotta find each other.
- Therapy is the first subscription service I can think of that forces you to take regular time out for yourself. It has a very real return on investment

### Professional & Work
- Burned a lot of money after leaving my first startup, but also wasted a lot of time worrying about burning money. Do one or the other; not both - worrying kills productivity. 
- Started getting more specific about the sort of thing I want to do for a living.

- Deliver early, collect feedback, iterate, rinse & repeat.

### Writing & Thinking
- Finally began using the internet effectively. Started a blog and got onto [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jborichevskiy). Connected with amazing people across the planet. Funny enough, some turned to be just down the street this whole time!

- Writing helps you think
    - TODO: embed tweets

- Don't be afraid to state the obvious. It may not be so obvious to others.
- Ideas evolve over time. Your hot take on something might inspire one, anger another, and cause a third to write a long post about it - [let the memes evolve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme#Memetic_lifecycle:_transmission,_retention). 
- Pay careful attention to memes which [hijack your emotions and encourage tribalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc) and the environments optimized for them.
- Hypothesis: framing something as a hypothesis helps calm the ego.
- Explore using paper, colored markers, poster boards, sticky notes, stickers, sharpies, whiteboards. These are very cheap and accessible brain interface tools.
- Start carrying around a notebook and a pen, everywhere you go. 
- Pay attention to the ideas that just keep coming back. In the shower, falling asleep in bed, during workouts. Dig at them, explore and explain them, visualize, and find others who are obsessed with similar ones. Find your [bus ticket obsession](http://www.paulgraham.com/genius.html).
- You don't really understand something until you can explain it on a napkin. 

### Diet & Health

- Slowly transitioning my diet to vegan. About 80% of the way there. 
- Sleep is non-negotiable. 
- Listen to your body. Expect a mid-day slump and plan accordingly. Go for a walk and some air. Watch a sunset.

### Love & Relationships

- Everyone is lovable, but no two people want to be loved the same way.
- Love is so much more than the tropes pushed by society. Don't be afraid to explore it. 

### Meeting People

- The key to good conversation: get the other person talking about things __they deeply care about__ and ask questions. You are providing a safe environment to explore, refine, and correct their ideas. In return, you get to learn something. Explore your shared reality together.
- It will be a long time before video communication comes close to having a long, in-person conversation over a few drinks at a quiet bar. If ever. Long-form written communication will have to do until then.
- Just say hi. 

### Things I've suspected for a while but really had confirmed this year

- The internet is the single most incredible invention in human history
- Most of humanity's potential has not been unlocked yet. We are just now starting to [explore progress](https://patrickcollison.com/progress) and how to optimize for it.
- Getting out to nature regularly is essential to sanity.

### The next decade is going to be absolutely wild. Some predictions:

- In 10 years, we're going to look back at today's social media like we do doctors' endorsements of smoking back in the day. And just as shocked at our ignorance.
    - Graphic/image?
    - {{[[TODO]]}} Rephrase this
    - There is a shit-storm of privacy regulation coming this way. 
- Misinformation is going to become a serious problem. Deepfakes, [speech synthesis](https://google.github.io/tacotron/publications/speaker_adaptation/), no standardized identity proof systems, bots, insecure electronic voting. Validation of news and events will be done bottom-up with chains of trust. 
    - Find that tweet about it?
    - It's becoming easier to craft the reality we want to believe.
- Individuals (artists, singers, journalists, teachers, authors) will continue to garner more influence and trust than the institutions they are employed by or representing (news agencies, schools, companies, governments).
- Real-time "productivity apps" such as Slack will be forced to evolve or die.
- Someone is going to figure out how to do search better than Google and wreck havoc. 
- Research-backed regulated psychedelic-assisted therapy will go mainstream.
    - MAPS
- NoCode is very real - we're going to see the barrier of entry to starting a company and fulfilling a business need plummeting as more people come online.
