This world is more beautiful and interconnected than my 16 or 20 year old self could have ever imagined. I trust this pattern will hold through the decades. 

Here are some things I’ve seen to be true so far. I hope they continue to be so because I can be sure of little else. 

Love

1. It all begins with and depends on and ends with love. 
2. Self love makes it possible to love others. The first priority is always one’s own stability.
3. Safety and acceptance are the most beautiful things one can give and be lucky enough to experience. 

Stories & Sharing

4. Everyone has a story. One full of fears, hopes, dreams, and regrets. Listen to them. Thank them.
5. Art is our expression of beauty and history too visceral for language to express. 
6. Ritual is powerful for cultivating desired mind states. This multiples with each additional ernest participant. 

Rules

7. No one has it all figured out. People we admire and look up to have and will make mistakes. We all will. 
8. Institutions consist of the same fallible people and when one acts a group, one can expect to be judged as a group.
9. Forgiveness and transparency are essential to any long lasting societal structure. 
10. Views on morality, rights, and religion change over the course of years. Sometimes in one night. Rarely on Twitter. 
11. Society is nothing but the shared norms we all agree too. They can and will change to guarantee the right of every person to feeling free and able to explore this world. 

Anxiety & Stress

12. Not all pressure is bad. All pressure is self-imposed, even when it comes from external sources. 
13. Productivity should not be confused for purpose. 
14. The body is a vessel. The better I treat it the better it treats me back.
15. Worrying about worry is a slippery slope into depression. 

Friends

16. Friends are people you support and encourage and celebrate. Through the good times and the bad. 
17. Kindness begets kindness and little favors became big favors become mutual cooperation and coordination. 
18. Distance changes things. You never know when you’re going to cross paths again so make every visit count.
19. When you’re trying to keep someone from hurting themselves, you can only do so much.

Happiness

20. Time in nature is looking at beautiful fractals with soothing sounds and smells to match. Patterns that have been around since before speech. 
21. Being surrounded by friends and sharing good food (especially cooked together) makes me feel grateful to be alive. 
22. Stars remind me of our smallness and leave me feeling grateful to witness any of them at all. Much of the universe’s future will be much more boring. 
23. Regular time alone is the foundation of sanity. 
24. Our world has a lot more room for beauty and at the end of the day there's nobody I'd rather be than myself.
