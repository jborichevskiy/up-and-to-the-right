This is my first attempt at a blog. Somewhere to post my musings, observations, or just links to interesting things. Don't know what it'll become yet - guess we'll find out together.

I started journaling a few years ago and find it to be immensely helpful in sorting out my thoughts about life. Occasionally I want to share my thoughts with people and figure this might be a good way to do so. 

Though I haven't been around for too long, I have had the privilege of witnessing some interesting events and meeting a ton of incredible people. Along the way I've learned a bit about myself and this amazing world, both good and bad. There are some things I'd love to tell my 18-year-old self - but given I can't do that due to some limitations with our understanding of time - the next best thing is reaching out to others searching for similar answers in hopes of lending an extra perspective. 

If this sounds interesting at all, feel free to subscribe or just check back in a while.
