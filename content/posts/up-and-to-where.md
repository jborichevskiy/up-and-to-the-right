The title of my site originally comes from phrase in a post of Tim Urban's I read a long time which resonated strongly with me.

The basic premise (though he does a much more wonderful job of explaining it) is that as humans we are *somewhere* on the spectrum of consciousness. This *somewhere* is likely higher than that of a dog's, and considerably higher than that of a beetle's. But that's only what's going on below - what about above? Well, we don't know - like the classic saying, does ant colony have an opinion about the construction of a ten-lane superhighway next to it? In the same way we may be staring at consciousness and completely miss it for what it really is.

So that's a bit depressing. What's the upside? The difference up to a single step may be absolutely massive - but what if we were to split the next step into smaller, sub-steps? It becomes a little more approachable. Hear me out: we all have those moments in life. Where we see a peek of the big picture. For some, it might be temporal - comparing the length of a single human life to the age of the universe. For others, it might be the absolute miracle of life: everything starting with two cells - only occurring because the same thing happened going back in time further than we can possibly imagine. Yet others might marvel at how little anyone understand what's really happening in the world - how everyone pretends to, and we all delude ourselves into accepting their leadership, advice, or commands. The sheer number of human beings on the planet, and how I will only meet an imperceptible fraction of the whole group. Or sitting on the edge of Horseshoe Bend as light breaks through the dark storm clouds, in complete awe of the timescales and processes involved. Or taking in the absolute vastness and complexity of natural systems on the planet: specifically energy and weather systems. Standing in the crowd of a concert, seeing the perfect synchronization and connection between the audience with the music. For me, it's any one of these, and others I haven't listed here - that give me a reminder reality check of precisely how tiny, inconsequential, improbable, and fragile our very existence is. 

And that, for me, is the closest thing to the perspective that a higher consciousness might have - knowing full well that this might be but a fraction compared to other sentient life out there - but is more than the wake-work-eat-relax-sleep-repeat haze I find much of my life passing me by in. And in those brief moments, I experience humility and wonder beyond anything else I know - I see other species on the planet and feel compassion and empathy. I see people struggling to take care of their families, trying to do what it takes to protect the ones they love most. The incredible souls in the world sacrificing so much of their comfort for the sake of others. And I can only see the beauty in it all. That against all odds, I - a collection of a bunch of atoms - has the chance every single day to experience and explore this incredible universe. To laugh, to cry, to feel, plan, love, create, enjoy, and build. And that I might perhaps connect with another human being and share with them a fraction of the joy I've gotten lucky enough to feel. That death is merely part of the cycle of life and that my atoms may someday be a part of any number of points of life in the future. I was dealt an incredible hand - the only way I see of using it is helping make this world a better place - to preserve that life, and increase the chances of it being there.  

Eventually, like many such things, the view fades. The sun sets, the song ends, the eagle disappears. Hunger, thirst, random memories, tiredness, a distraction, or simple boredom (somehow) eventually sets in and my mind goes back to its usual game of worrying about things I can't control. However I get to keep a slightly better picture of the path that led me to that vantage point. Sometimes, that path involves helping others and giving my time to them. Others, it's a Wikipedia binge starting with some random topic and ending with the big, perhaps forever unanswered questions. Yet others it's simply laying on a houseboat in another country looking out at the moon and focusing on the sheer distance involved. And so I do my best to follow those signals, like a moth to the flame. With fewer preconceptions and judgement. More acceptance, curiosity, and humility, and most importantly, love. There is no formula, it can't be forced or triggered, but it can be assisted. And so I try to optimize my actions to make it happen.

So, tying it all up again - why Up and to the Right? Because it's a reminder of the direction of progress. Like a compass heading, a sign of which way to go - but not a destination in and of itself. One that may have ups and downs, and may need correction as new information is acquired and understood. The direction of the next step on the "consciousness staircase". A reminder that data is only smooth from far out - up close it is an inconsistent, noisy, unrepresentative sample of the big picture. 

Over time I've found various descriptions of this feeling as described by other people. Sometimes I see religion as an organized attempt at finding, cultivating, and sharing that love, but an attempt that so often ends only in more pain and division instead of less. I believe many of us experience this feeling with our own distinct flavor colored by our lives, understandings, dreams, and love. Which is precisely what makes it so wonderful to hear about other people's moments - it's the closest thing to see seeing reality through another person's eyes, from a different perspective on the same objective reality. Kurzeasgt calls it Optimistic Nihilism. Tim Urban calls it Truthism?. Carl Sagan calls it spirituality, and I think that's the one that resonates most with me. Like all things, labels are only useful in describing and grouping similar things - and I'm learning that the most special things are also the hardest to label, explain, measure, and categorize. They just are.
