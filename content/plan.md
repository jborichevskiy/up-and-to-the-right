### Cozyroom.xyz

Helping [Azlen](https://azlen.me/) build [cozyroom.xyz](https://cozyroom.xyz), an experimental spatial audio environment to make online interactions feel more natural. Open questions: 

* How do we increase the feeling of presence in online applications?

* Can we enable more realtime self-expression in mediums other than video? 

* How might we build friendly and accessible [third places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place) on the internet? 

Next steps: user interviews/research, learning Vue.js, and a proper launch.

### An Open Plan

Collaborating with [David](https://www.dmeh.net/) to make it easier for anyone to discover and encourage creative & intellectual pursuits across the internet. We hope to do this with `/plan` pages, such as this one. 

Explore others' pages or add your own at [anopenplan.com](https://www.anopenplan.com/).

Next steps: really ironing out what we want this to be and spreading the idea.

### Writing

Though I get easily distracted, the next topics I hope to explore in detail: developing meaningful connections online, defining productivity relative to my goals, my ideal working environment, the balance between privacy and the open internet, and advice to my younger self. 

### jborichevskiy.com

A continuous exploration in making my corner of the internet as useful and interesting as possible.

* _For me_: a central place for collecting and presenting my creative work, highlighting other people & projects I find meaningful, and a way of holding myself accountable. 

* _For you_: making my work and bits of learning shareable, offering my help wherever possible, and making it easier for anyone to use the internet to their advantage.

Next steps: integrate parts of my [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com) database, better tagging, hyperlinking, transclusion, and incremental full text search.
