      <description>The title of my site originally comes from phrase in a post of Tim Urban&amp;rsquo;s I read a long time which resonated strongly with me.
The basic premise (though he does a much more wonderful job of explaining it) is that as humans we are somewhere on the spectrum of consciousness. This somewhere is likely higher than that of a dog&amp;rsquo;s, and considerably higher than that of a beetle&amp;rsquo;s. But that&amp;rsquo;s only what&amp;rsquo;s going on below - what about above?</description>

      <description>This is my first attempt at a blog. Somewhere to post my musings, observations, or just links to interesting things. Don&amp;rsquo;t know what it&amp;rsquo;ll become yet - guess we&amp;rsquo;ll find out together.
I started journaling a few years ago and find it to be immensely helpful in sorting out my thoughts about life. Occasionally I want to share my thoughts with people and figure this might be a good way to do so.</description>
